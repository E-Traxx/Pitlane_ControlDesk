# Pitlane_ControlDesk

ControlDesk-like development UI for **pitlane_rs**.

Pitlane_ControlDesk is used during development of the **2027 E-Traxx ECUs** to visualize and inspect data streamed over USB/Serial (and similar links). It provides an Arduino Serial Plotter–style experience, plus the kind of signal/parameter dashboard workflow you’d expect from tools like dSPACE ControlDesk.

Compatible with **ESP32** and **STM32** (and generally anything that can stream structured telemetry).
